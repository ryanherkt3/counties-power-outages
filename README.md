# Counties Power Outages Website

**NOTE:** The developers who built the official Counties Power Outages website have made API updates which has made fetching the outages data not work on my live website, so the live link has been temporarily removed until this gets fixed.

This website is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - a modern React framework, and hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). This website / source code is not affiliated with Counties Power.

For a package manager, npm is preferred (Node.js must also be installed) - https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm.

### Installation

To clone the local repository and install the Node/NPM packages, run:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest counties-power-outages --use-npm --example "https://github.com/ryanherkt3/counties-power-outages/tree/main"
npm install
```

For local development, Python is also required. To download version 3.12 go to https://www.python.org/downloads/.

Then, to install the required Python packages, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Local Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

And browse to http://localhost:3000.

### Website Features

* Outages page with filters - search for a specific outage by status (Active / Scheduled / Postponed / Cancelled), start and end date, and by the location name.
* Notification system (WIP ðŸ”§) - subscribe to notifications for outages in your neighbourhood without the need for an account.
** **Note:** if developing locally, the notification system requires a database to be set up (e.g. on Vercel via [Neon Postgres](https://neon.tech/)) and `.env` variables for this to work. You will also need a [Resend](https://resend.com/) account to be able to send the notification emails, as well as a purchased domain.

### Future improvements

* Notifications: edit page, unsubscribe page.
* Contact form (for bug reports etc).
* A filter on the outages page for outages per page (configurable to 5 / 10 / 15).

### Bug reports, Feature requests

For any bugs or feature requests, create an issue on the repo's [Issues page](https://github.com/ryanherkt3/counties-power-outages/issues) with the appropriate label.
